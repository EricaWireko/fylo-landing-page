## Overview
Build a two-column landing page and get it looking close to the design as possible

### The Challenge
Your users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### The Designs

The designs I had to follow can be found here: [Screenshots of the designs](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1JOlV_rZTZTYoOVYijY9SS_zqqUjKhmEE)



## My Process

I used the figma design file for design specifications. I created a simple HTML page, added a README file and the stylesheet.

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Github workflow
