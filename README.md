## Overview
Build a two-column landing page and get it looking close to the design as possible

### The Challenge
Your users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### The Designs

The design I had to follow can be found here: [Screenshots of the design](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1JZ2R8y_wDIftWlyueVfI3pR9Kyko6wDw)

- Live Site URL: [Vercel App](https://fylo-landing-page-ten-gamma.vercel.app/)

## My Process

 - I used the figma design file for design specifications. I created a simple HTML page, added a README file and the CSS stylesheet for starters.
 - I used Git and Github for version control and to track changes and any design modifications I added.
 - I used vercel's free deployment service to host my live site.

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Github workflow

### What I Learnt

- I learnt a lot of advanced CSS and HTML concepts while building this static page. 
- I learnt how to properly use divs, id's and classes in HTML for CSS styling. 
- I revised CSS Specificity while creating this page. 
- I also learnt how to use media queries, a concept I was struggling with before the onset of this project.
- Through this project I learnt how to modify warning messages in HTML using the properties.
- I learnt how to use Github workflow and Git Bash.
- I learnt about Vercel App, Github Pages and other free ways of deploying static web pages.

### Continued Development
I still want to go over CSS positioning and other advanced CSS concepts.
